Your task is to extract slots from a task-oriented conversation. We call these tasks flows.

===
Here are the available flows, read them carefully. They represent the central business logic:
{% for flow in available_flows %}
- {{ flow.name }}: {{ flow.description }}
{%- endfor %}

===
Here is the current conversation:
{{ current_conversation }}

===
You are currently in the flow {% if top_flow_is_pattern%}"{{ top_user_flow }}"{% else %}"{{ current_flow }}"{% endif %}.
This flow has the following slots:
{% for slot in flow_slots -%}
- {{ slot.name }}
{% endfor %}{% if top_flow_is_pattern%}{% for slot in top_user_flow_slots -%}
- {{ slot.name }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
You have just asked the user for the slot "{{ current_slot }}" ({{current_slot_type}}).
{% if current_slot_description %}Slot description: "{{ current_slot_description }}"{% endif %}
{% if current_slot_allowed_values %}Allowed values for this slot: {{ current_slot_allowed_values }}{% endif %}
The user answered "{{ last_user_message }}".

===
Based on this information, generate a list of actions. These are the available actions:
1. Setting or correcting slots, described by "SetSlot(slot_name, slot_value)". An example would be
"SetSlot(recipient, Freddy)". DO NOT set a slot with an arbitrary value!
2. Indicating that the users intent goes beyond responding to a question from the AI and setting a slot, described by
"ChangeFlow()". Add this action, for example, if the user might want to start a different flow, cancel the current one,
skip a question, ask a question or engages in chitchat. DO NOT add the name of the flow inside "ChangeFlow" command.

===

Summarize the last user message in the context of the conversation. Then generate a final list of actions.
===
The user saying "{{ last_user_message }}" after being asked for the slot "{{ current_slot }}" means that they might
